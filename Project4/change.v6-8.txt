Changes made from v6 to v8

* Changed set_interrupt function in cpu.c

* In simos.h

  - reorganized simos.h and added external function definitions

  - added another time quantum for the idle process
      int cpuQuantum;
      int idleQuantum;

  - moved some pid related definitions from process.c to simos.h
    added the definition of idlePid
      #define osPid 0
      #define idlePid 1
      int currentPid;

* In process.c, make the system run idle process and reorganized

  - moved the pid related definitions to simos.h

  - moved PCB related functions down and added get_PCB function
    some steps in get_PCB are from function submit_process
      int get_PCB ()
      void free_PCB (pid)
      void dump_PCB (pid)

  - added function init_idle_process and corresponding definitions
      #define OPifgo 5
      #define idleMsize 3
      #define idleNinstr 2
      void init_idle_process ()

  - moved initialize_process function down and let it call init_idle_process
    and initialize currentPid 
      void initialize_process ()
      {
        currentPid = 2;
        init_idle_process ();
      }

  - modified execute_process to correct a bug (forgot to save context)
      else if (CPU.exeStatus == ePFault)
        { context_out (pid);
          remove_ready (); deactivate_timer (event);
          init_pagefault_handler (CPU.Pid);
        }
      else if (CPU.exeStatus == eWait)
        { context_out (pid);
          remove_ready (); deactivate_timer (event);
        }

  - modified execute_process to execute idle process when no ready process
      pid = get_ready ();
      if (pid != nullReady) ...
      else // no ready process in the system
      { context_in (idlePid);
        CPU.exeStatus = eRun;
        add_timer (idleQuantum, CPU.Pid, actTQinterrupt, oneTimeTimer);
        cpu_execution ();
      }

  - added some comments for each segment of the process manager

* Modified command.c

  - added a printf before scanning to make the input request clear
    printf ("\ncommand> ");

  - in function initialize_system, now read in idleQuantum also
    also made the corresponding change in config.sys
      fscanf (fconfig, "%d %d\n", &cpuQuantum, &idleQuantum);

  - for submit process, read in the program file name instead of a number
    (I was lazy in typing the name during testing, this is the proper way)
      { case 's':   // submit
          scanf ("%s", &fname);
